# Supporting Add-On Developers

The goal of this repository is to provide useful code segments, examples and tools to add-on developers in order to better "weather" the transition to the new extension structure of Thunderbird 78: MailExtensions.

The primary resource to learn about MailExtensions is the [Thunderbird Add-On Developer Guide](https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/about-add-ons) and its [Update Guide for Thunderbird 78](https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/updating/tb78), all sources linked there can be found here.
