# Supporting Add-On Developers

The goal of this repository is to provide useful code snippets, examples and tools to add-on developers in order to better "weather" the transition to the new extension structure of Thunderbird 78: MailExtensions.

To get started with MailExtensions, we suggest to check out these resources first:
* [Thunderbird Add-On Developer Guide](https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/about-add-ons)
* [MailExtension API Documentation](https://thunderbird-webextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
